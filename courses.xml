                <slide title="Balance Method" content="Keep equations balanced by doing the same operation to both sides. If you add 5 to one side, add 5 to the other side too." />
                <slide title="Ready to Practice" content="You're now ready to solve your first equation! Remember to keep both sides balanced as you work." />
